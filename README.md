## About me

I believe that creativity must be the way we earn our place in the world. Thus, I aim to use my creativity to contribute to the benefit of society, particularly in the development of better cities. As digital systems multiply across the urban landscape, they produce immense streams of data that can help inform how we manage and plan our cities. Through data science, we can now measure issues that have been central to urban planning since its conception, such as equity, environment, value creation, service provision, public opinion, and the effects of physical form.

Ultimately, my goal is to use data to enhance learning, provoke dialogue and inspire policy change.

## My work

I've been working on analyzing the urban growth in Metropolitan Zones of Mexico.
